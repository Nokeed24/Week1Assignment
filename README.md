Week 1 assignment for Codaisseur

Welcome to THE CODING DEAD

Fairly straightforward, the page asks for your hero's Name. After that, the UI is updated but your hero is lacking a weapon.
Luckily, Rick Grimes is a law enforcement agent and has some weapons lying around in his patrol car when the zombie apocalypse
breaks out. All the items available for pickup have a YELLOW outline whereas the bed with the RED outline allows your hero to 
recover strength and gain back all the health lost. Green is for the Backpack which, when clicked, prompts the user for an index
of the weapon to equip. You can see your item's index in the bottom left where the inventory is displayed. You hero could take on 
a zombie 1-on-1 only throwing fists but it's strongly advised to pick up a weapon and equip it for maximum death dealing capacity. 
When it's time to fight the undead, just click on the zombie's ugly face. It will start a battle in which the hero deals damage 
first followed by the zombie dealing damage, in turns, until one of the two is dead**. You can also change your hero's name in case
you misspelled it or you don't like it. Have fun!

**The zombie image is not disappearing or being deleted from the DOM on purpose. After the dobattle function is called, zombie 
health is set back to 10. At the end of the day it's a zombie apocalypse, the world is ending, there's COUNTLESS OF THEM!!!**
